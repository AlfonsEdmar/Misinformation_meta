```{r}
study_3 <- read_excel(here(
  "open_data_analyses/data/Luke_et_al_2017_study_3.xlsx"))

names(study_3) <- to_any_case(string = names(study_3))

study_3$condition <- factor(study_3$condition)
study_3$version_a_b <- factor(study_3$version_a_b)

```


```{r}
#n by condition 
summary(study_3$condition)

#age by condition

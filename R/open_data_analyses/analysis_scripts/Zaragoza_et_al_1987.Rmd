The goal here is to extract standard deviations from a reported standard error on the mean difference of misled vs non-misled items. All comparisons ar within groups.  

```{r}
# Standard errors
SE1 = .1
SE2 = .06
SE3 = .12
SE4 = .07

# Sample sizes
n1 = 48
n2 = 174
n3 = 54
n4 = 228

# Infering standard deviations
SD1 = (SE1 * sqrt( n1 * n1) ) / sqrt(n1 + n1)
SD2 = (SE2 * sqrt( n2 * n2) ) / sqrt(n2 + n2)
SD3 = (SE3 * sqrt( n3 * n3) ) / sqrt(n3 + n3)
SD4 = (SE4 * sqrt( n4 * n4) ) / sqrt(n4 + n4)

# validating the t-statistics with reported statistics(obs)
t1_obs <- 2.66
t2_obs <- '<1'
t3_obs <- 3.64
t4_obs <- '<1'

t1 <- (.75 - .48) / (sqrt( (SD1^2/n1) + (SD1^2/n1) ))
t2 <- (.33 - .33) / (sqrt( (SD2^2/n2) + (SD2^2/n2) ))
t3 <- (.82 - .61) / (sqrt( (SD3^2/n3) + (SD3^2/n3) ))
t4 <- (.58 - .60) / (sqrt( (SD4^2/n4) + (SD4^2/n4) ))

(.75 - .48) / SE1
(.33 - .33) / SE2
(.82 - .61) / SE3
(.58 - .60) / SE4

# Something is not correct. The third effect is off. Calculating the t from the standard error does not change it. Either it is misreported or I have made bad calculations.  

```

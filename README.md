#Large scale meta-analysis on the Misinformation effect

In this meta-analysis, we provide a detailed synthesis of the misinformation effect along with the assessment of several moderators. The combined results of 401 studies with 1,385 effects sizes across 47,700 participants are reported.

Installation: 
- In order to replicate the analysis a working copy of R and Rstudio are required. The vast majority of code are formed based of functions from the tidyverse and metafor. For ease of use, downloading the entire repository is probably the best course of action due to model contingencies.  

Usage: The data is present in the data files. The cleaned data is the most reliable due to it being reviewed and cleaned. All models used for the published paper are available to load and specified to do so if the entire repository is downloaded so no refitting of the specified models are needed.

Data Sources: The data is compiled by all contributors through data-base searches. Open data is reproduced with permission from the original authors. 

Methodology: We use three-level meta regressions to estimate over all fixed effects. These can be quite intensive to fit so planning of model construction is advised. 


Contributions: If you have additional data you want to share with us please contact us by email. If you would like to add to our analysis with additional models forking the project and adding new codes would be a good course of action.

License: The data is free for everyone to reproduce as long as proper citation is provided. Note that the open data should not be freely distributed without consulting the original authors. 

Ultimately, this project is a product of standing on the shoulders of giants - synthesising a scientific literature starting in the 1970s. So while we are proud of putting this data set together, the bulk of the credit goes to the hundreds of researchers all doing their part to further our knowledge.

# What Fifty Years of Research on the Misinformation Effect Can Tell Us: A Meta-Analytic Review

This repository contains the code and supporting materials for a meta-analysis
of the misinformation effect. Code and data to reproduce all analyses are
available here.

## Reproducing the analyses

The `data` folder contains the raw data file used during data extraction, a
codebook, a post-cleaning data file, and a subset of the cleaned data that only
features effect sizes that were included in the primary model reported in the
paper. Generally, the cleaned data will be most useful for those wanting to
reproduce the analyses or conduct further explorations.

To reproduce all analyses we recommend running the following scripts (found in
the `R` folder) in the following order:

- `mema_misinformation-primary-analysis.R`
- `mema_subgroup-analysis.R`
- `mema_pet-peese-supplement.R`
- `mema_model-tables.R`
